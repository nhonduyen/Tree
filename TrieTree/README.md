A Trie (pronounced as "try") is a type of search tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. It is a kind of prefix tree, where each node represents a common prefix of some strings.

Use Cases for Trie
Autocomplete: Tries are widely used for autocomplete suggestions. By storing a dictionary of words in a Trie, you can quickly find all words that start with a given prefix.

Spell Checker: Tries can be used to implement a spell checker. By storing a dictionary of correct words, you can quickly verify if a given word exists in the dictionary.

IP Routing: In networking, tries are used for IP routing. Each node in the trie represents a bit in the IP address, and the trie structure helps to quickly find the longest prefix match for routing.

Dictionary Word Search: Tries can efficiently store and search for words in a dictionary, especially useful in word games like Boggle and Scrabble.

Genome Sequencing: In bioinformatics, tries can be used to store sequences of nucleotides (DNA sequences) and quickly search for specific sequences or patterns.
