A Quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. 
Quadtrees are often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants. 

Use cases for Quadtrees:

Spatial Indexing: Quadtrees are excellent for indexing two-dimensional spatial data, making them useful in geographic information systems (GIS) and mapping applications.
Collision Detection: In game development and physics simulations, Quadtrees can efficiently detect potential collisions between objects.
Image Processing: Used for image compression, particularly in systems that use variable compression for different areas of an image.
Mesh Generation: In computer graphics and computational geometry for generating adaptive meshes.
Cellular Network Planning: For optimizing the placement of cellular towers and managing network coverage.
Computer Graphics: For culling operations in rendering pipelines, helping to determine which objects are visible in a scene.
Terrain Rendering: In video games and simulations for managing level-of-detail in terrain rendering.
Pathfinding: Can be used to optimize pathfinding algorithms in 2D spaces.
Nearest Neighbor Searches: Efficient for finding the nearest neighbors of a given point in 2D space.
Data Visualization: For efficiently rendering large datasets on 2D plots or maps.
Robotics: For spatial reasoning and navigation in autonomous systems.
Weather Forecasting: Used in some weather prediction models for managing spatial data.
